I recently read an article [1] in the New York Times about how poor air quality was in New Delhi, India. It also pointed out that for all the press that China gets about poor air quality, only one of its cities is even in the top 50-worst cities globally for air pollution. I became curious enough to download air quality data from the World Health Organization [2] and turn it into a map which shows the 50 worst-polluted cities as measured by the amount of particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in size (PM10 standard), which is the size of particles that start to severely impact lung function [3].

The best (“least-worst”) city on this list of about 50-worst cities has a PM10 level of 136 micrograms per cubic meter which greatly exceeds EPA annual air pollution standards [3]. It’s remarkable to me how concentrated in the developing world these cities are—a useful reminder that the First World partly relies on “exporting” pollution to live in cleaner environments—but also leads to wonder how much geography (i.e. the Himalayas) makes it rather worse to live in an Indian city than in most Chinese cities (as a broad-strokes example).
